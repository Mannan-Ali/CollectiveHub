 Logout Implementation
For logging out, the middleware allows you to check if a user is already logged in (i.e., has a valid token) and to invalidate that token (e.g., by removing the token from cookies or adding it to a blacklist).
With verifyJWT handling token verification and user lookup, the logout logic in the controller becomes simpler, as it only needs to clear the relevant cookies or token storage. The controller doesn

Logout Is Only About Clearing Tokens
Logging out is primarily about invalidating or clearing the access and refresh tokens. You donâ€™t need to re-validate or retrieve the user's full data to log them out.
The purpose of logout is to end the session, which means removing the tokens stored on the client and server, not fetching or confirming user data.

Why Use verifyJWT Middleware for Logout?
For logout, the middleware approach helps by ensuring that the access token is valid before proceeding to remove or invalidate it, making the logout process more secure. This way, only authenticated users can log out, and it standardizes how tokens are verified before invalidation.

In summary, using verifyJWT as middleware ensures clean, modular, and reusable code that simplifies route protection and promotes secure, consistent authentication checks across the application.
