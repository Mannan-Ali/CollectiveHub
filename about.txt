This file is mainly for notes and why the follwing folders are made and etc.

Inside Source:
1. Controllers :  mainly functionality 
2. db : database connection (moslty same for mongo or postgress)
    -> index.js : this file is used to implement the db connection which is imported in index.js of src
3. middleware : mostly for verfication of what kind of req and etc
4. models : for data modelling 
5. routes : get post in different folder as from here they will get complex.
6. utils : utilities files like that can be used multiple times like 
           file upload , mailing , tokens handling 


7. Prettier : (Not the vs code one but the plugin in nodejs)
why do we use it ?
when we code professionally lot of people work on a single project 
so what happens is like someone does not put ; in js files but others do so we 
can declare in Prettier that always end with ; 

-> we can make our custom pretier 
 :-> run npm i -D Prettier
 :-> now we need to create a 2 files
    a. .prettierrc : here will we write what we need even if we forget to do like trailling commas wherever needed
    b. /prettierignore : which file should be ignored 


8. Constans.js : it stores the variable that will be used in many files so if changes will be needed 
we can directly can it in constants its just like env but it is not hided
