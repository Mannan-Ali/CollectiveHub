This file is mainly for notes and why the follwing folders are made and etc.

Inside Source:
1. Controllers :  mainly functionality 
2. db : database connection (moslty same for mongo or postgress)
    -> index.js : this file is used to implement the db connection which is imported in index.js of src
3. middleware : mostly for verfication of what kind of req and etc
4. models : for data modelling 
5. routes : get post in different folder as from here they will get complex.
6. utils : utilities files like that can be used multiple times like 
           file upload , mailing , tokens handling 


7. Prettier : (Not the vs code one but the plugin in nodejs)
why do we use it ?
when we code professionally lot of people work on a single project 
so what happens is like someone does not put ; in js files but others do so we 
can declare in Prettier that always end with ; 

-> we can make our custom pretier 
 :-> run npm i -D Prettier
 :-> now we need to create a 2 files
    a. .prettierrc : here will we write what we need even if we forget to do like trailling commas wherever needed
    b. /prettierignore : which file should be ignored 


8. Constans.js : it stores the variable that will be used in many files so if changes will be needed 
we can directly can it in constants its just like env but it is not hided


9. middleware : (can aslo be called verfication or checking like if req has xyz than olny send res)
   ->when the req is made to the server 
   ->before sending the res to the browser what we can do is check if 
   ->the browser is worty of the data or can the browser understand the data 
   ->who is the browser or whos frontend it is using this middleware 
   ->
This all happens in between when the req is made and res is send 
 

10. In total app.get/post etc we have ( err,req,res,next)
    we know that next is used to tell the compilar to move onto the next function or next line of code we are 
    done here mostly used with custom middlewares 

11. Now we will work on models , here points to remember are
-> the photos and vidoes will be stroed on 3rd party apps like aws and 
   in return we will get a link that we will store in db
